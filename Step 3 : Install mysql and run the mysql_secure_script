1. sudo apt install mysql-server

2. sudo mysql_secure_installation

3.Failed! Error: SET PASSWORD has no significance for user 'root'@'localhost' as the authentication method used doesn't store authentication data in the MySQL server. Please consider using ALTER USER instead if you want to change auth

Open the terminal application.
Terminate the mysql_secure_installation from another terminal using the killall command:
sudo killall -9 mysql_secure_installation
Start the mysql client:
sudo mysql
Run the following SQL query:
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'SetRootPasswordHere';
exit
Then run the following command to secure it:
sudo mysql_secure_installation
When promoted for the password enter the SetRootPasswordHere (or whatever you set when you ran the above SQL query)
That is all.

4. Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
sudo mysql -u root -p
